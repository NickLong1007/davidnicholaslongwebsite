        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is David Nicholas Long. I have started this website as a place to learn CSS, HTML and JavaScipt. My hope is to eventully share some of the projects that I am working on. 
            It will be a slow process as my experince with HTML and CSS is limited.
